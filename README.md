#Purpose

The purpose of this app will be to embed the client's Instagram feed onto the website that said client has hired me to design (mixonesound.com). 
This app will simply request the client's Instagram posts when the gallery page on their website is loaded. If rate limit issues are encountered
posts may need to be cached in some way to reduce calls to the Instagram API. If my client wants their deleted posts to be deleted from whatever
cache I implement, I can either implement logic to do it automatically, or do it manually on their request.
